            Angular - Front end development


            Basic commands

            1. to create project - ng new project name
            2. to run a project  - ng serve/  ng serve --open
            3. to create component - ng g c component name
            4. to create service - ng g s service name
            5. to create directives - ng g d directive name
            6. to build Angular application - ng build --prod

            Basic concepts
            decorators stores a data in another data

         1. component - to create HTML, css, typescript, file
                root component - Appcomponent

         2. Module - to add libraries to the project 
                root module  - Appmodule
         3. Data Binding    - data sharing between html and ts
                types   :
                    1. One way binding  :
                        1.1 component to view (TS to HTML)
                            Methods using

                            >String Interpolation : syntax - {{variable name}}
                            >Property Binding  : binding html tag attributes : syntax - [attribute]="variable name"
                        1.2 view to component (HTML to TS)
                            methods
                            >Event binding : syntax : (event)="function call()

                            >Event binding : syntax : (event)="function call($event) //$event is the details of the elements that we want to bind.
                                                                                        the $event is passed to the TS file
                            >Template referencing variables -     syntax: #variable name 
                                                                pass these variable names in the function                                                       

                    2. two way binding  -
                            2.1 using ngmodel - import formsmodule in Appmodule  
                            syntax : [(ngModel)]="variable-name"         
                            value is assigned to the class variables

        4. To set up path for a component   : defined in approutingmodule
            syntax: (path:'',component:componentClassname)
            for creating next page give routerLink,
            >> to redirect from one page to another is navigate by URL and in javascript it is window.location

            >> router outlet selector set in the appcomponent.html 

        5. Dependency injection : data sharing between 2 different classes, done in constructors

        Need to design the register html page. copied the login html content and edit it by adding username field

    6.Angular services  - for redundant data holding (reuse data)

    7. ngSubmit- to submit entire form  syntax: (ngSubmit)="function-call"                    

    8. Angular forms (validating the inputs which is entered by user)
        8.1 Template Driven forms - design html
            >> html page

        8.2 Model driven forms - create model in ts
            >> values are stored in variables in model not in the class variables
            >>creating a model in the ts file and link it to the html page
            >>values entered in html is saved in the model forms
            >>validation will be easier

            8.2.1 Reactive forms - Add inbuilt validations: import library- ReactiveFormsModule  in appModule

                a reactive should have 
                - class Form builder 
                - Dependency inject from the formbuilder class :Form group, Form array, Form control in the ts file

            >>to bind html to model formcontrolName attribute is used instead of ngModel

    9. Angular directives- to manipulate document objective Model (DOM)    
        
        DOM- entire html, css, javascript view

            9.1  Component Directives - in angular html view is changed by using component

            9.2 structural directives - change the DOM structure based on a condition, by adding or removing html elements

                9.2.1. ngIf - based on condition html changing
                            syntax - *ngIf="condition" which is given on the html tag that needs to be change

                9.2.2. ngFor - displaying a loop as a for loop  
                            syntax - *ngFor="let iterator of array name"          
           
            9.3 Attribute directives - to apply set of style to html    
                9.3.1 Predifined -based on a condition eg:ngclass

                9.3.2 Userdefined -        
   
    10. Local storage - to permanently store data in browser
        10.1 to store - setItem()

        10.2 to get the data - getItem()

        10.3 to remove the data - removeItem()

    11. Angular pipes - to convert the input data forms
            syntax : expression | pipe operator : 'pipe Arguments'

    12. Animation

    13.parent - child communication

            13.1- parent to child communication- Input decerator

            13.2 - child to parent communication - Output decerator

    14.Event Emitter - to generate user defined events

        14.1 emit() - to occur the event        


    15. User defined directives- to highlight or style certain tags or content
